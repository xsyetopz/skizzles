# Skizzles ✨

![Skizzles logo](assets/logo.png)

Skizzles is a reviewable Codex harness and packaging project. Its canonical
source tree contains reusable skills, hooks, runtime tools, and release
packaging.

## What’s inside

- **Runtime** — command-output management classifies useful build/test commands
  and bounds noisy output. Fourth Wall: Terra supplies verified evidence and
  commands; parallel Luna owners implement and validate disjoint slices; Sol
  supplies design and adversarial judgment.
- **Analysis and labs** — usage analyzer provides privacy-conscious, read-only
  rollout analysis with explicit `CODEX_HOME`. Container Lab includes a skill,
  full canonical source project, bundled CLI/reaper, compatibility descriptor,
  and safe doctor boundary for disposable Docker Compose labs.
- **Models and roles** — opt-in Luna V2 model-catalog overlay with launchd
  refresher preserves the official catalog and enables proven Luna workers in
  native MultiAgentV2; opt-in developer root prompt and generated
  Triage/Worker/Designer/QA/Review/Deployment roles.
- **Skills and setup** — public skill collection covers auth semantics, Cargo optimization,
  completion contracts, counterfactual engineering, design proof gates, legacy
  cleanup, Rinf boundaries, project tooling, and a gated designer runtime.
  The public `install-skizzles` skill covers optional host wiring after a
  skill-only install; hooks support passive native or proactive Fourth Wall
  configuration without changing unrelated `config.toml` settings.

Canonical roots and workspace packages are maintained once, then staged into a
versioned plugin.

## Choose an installation surface

### Stable plugin

**WIP:** Use the official Codex marketplace/plugin flow to install a released
`skizzles` plugin. It packages the skills, hooks, runtime helpers, branding,
and runnable Container Lab CLI/reaper together. Plugin skills are namespaced.

### Individual skills

Install just the skills you want with the Skills CLI:

```sh
bunx skills add https://github.com/robertmsale/skizzles --skill install-skizzles
```

Add `--skill <name>` for another public skill, or omit it to choose
interactively. Skill-only installs do not activate Skizzles hooks or runtime
helpers; [install-skizzles](skills/install-skizzles/SKILL.md) explains the
optional next steps.

The plugin and a direct copy are alternative installation surfaces for the same
skill. Remove an existing direct Skizzles skill before installing or enabling
the plugin, and do not directly install a skill already supplied by the enabled
plugin.

### Source-linked development

For maintainer work, use a local checkout and point the Skills CLI at its
canonical `skills/` directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robertmsale/skizzles.git
cd skizzles
bunx skills add ./skills --skill install-skizzles
```

This repository includes the canonical Container Lab CLI/reaper, not
documentation alone. A source-linked installation runs them directly from the
checkout; the stable plugin carries dependency-self-contained bundles. If you
install only a copied skill, `install-skizzles` guides Codex to obtain a selected
Skizzles version and install the complete surface; the launcher can use an existing
`codex-container-lab` PATH command. Host PATH and LaunchAgent wiring are optional, explicit,
reversible, and machine-local.

After installing the complete plugin surface, choose:

- **Passive orchestration** — enables packaged hooks; leaves Codex’s native
  MultiAgentV2 defaults completely alone.
- **Aggressive orchestration** — also enables MultiAgentV2; keeps up to six task
  slots available per root session for bounded parallel teams; adds
  identifier-neutral pointers to the Fourth Wall skill advertised in the active
  inventory. Six is a ceiling, not a target: schedule at most one heavyweight
  operation per root campaign, keep CGC graph queries available, and retain
  explicit authorization for new CGC indexing or persistent watchers. If
  abnormal memory pressure appears, stop launching new work and capture bounded
  evidence rather than arbitrarily terminating CGC or Redis.
- **Native instructions** (the default) — leaves Codex's model instructions
  untouched.
- **Skizzles instructions** — installs a developer-facing root prompt and seven
  fixed capability-bearing roles: Worker Luna xhigh; Triage and QA Terra medium;
  Default Luna high; Designer Sol medium; Review Sol high; Deployment Sol xhigh.
  There are no implementation escalation variants:
  Terra supplies verified evidence and commands; Luna Workers own clear slices;
  Sol judges the result. Select the generated `agent_type` without separate
  model overrides; use the smallest useful positive numbered `fork_turns` value
  so Codex applies it. A larger positive number safely means “up to this many
  turns,” not full-history mode; do not use context-free or full-history forks,
  which bypass the selected-role handoff. Eviction or reload ends the
  continuity guarantee.

Preview the full developer setup:

Before running `configure`, use Codex CLI `0.146.0-alpha.3` or newer. Do not
use `0.145.0` for Skizzles orchestration: it is a known broken, token-wasting
host. The installer probes the selected binary before any RPC, receipt, or
configuration write. Configuration requires a POSIX host with an owned probe
process group; transfer-only installation remains independent.

```sh
just configure-preview /absolute/target/codex-home aggressive skizzles
```

If `codex` is unavailable on `PATH`, prefix both invocations with the absolute
binary override `CODEX_BIN=/absolute/path/to/codex`. When `skizzles`
instructions are selected, these recipes use this checkout as the source root.
Review the reported keys and target, then repeat without `--dry-run` by applying
the same choices after explicit authorization:

```sh
just configure-apply /absolute/target/codex-home aggressive skizzles
```

The lifecycle uses Codex’s own atomic config editor; it preserves comments and
unrelated settings and records only the keys it owns for drift-safe restoration.
It never edits `AGENTS.md`, approvals, permissions, goals, model defaults, or
MCP registrations. Prompt replacement happens only with the explicit
`--instructions skizzles` option. See
[install-skizzles](skills/install-skizzles/SKILL.md) for restoration and the
complete contract.

See [Codex compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) for the supplied CLI/Desktop
matrix, active-inventory boundary, configured-role condition, and non-Desktop
fallback.

The optional Luna V2 overlay lives in `runtime/model-catalog.ts`. It regenerates
a complete static catalog from the newest valid normal cache or installed Codex
binary, changes only Luna's compatibility marker, and becomes a no-op when
upstream enables V2 officially. Its launchd template watches both sources and
runs every five minutes; catalog changes take effect after the next app-server
restart. See `assets/model-catalog-installation.md` before activating it.

With `just` installed, run `just` to list maintainer shortcuts. From a fresh
checkout, use `just setup`; when dependencies are already installed, use
`just package` for the complete package boundary.

## Generated plugin checks

Build and verify the generated plugin from source with:

```sh
just setup
```

`just setup` installs dependencies with the committed lockfile, then runs the
complete package boundary. The boundary runs `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`,
`bun run plugin:check`, `bun run plugin:build`, and `bun run plugin:check` in
that exact order. The first check inspects the existing generated output,
`plugin:build` writes generated roles and plugin output, and the final check
checks the rebuilt projection. When dependencies are already installed and
packaging inputs changed, run:

```sh
just package
```

`just package` skips dependency installation but runs the same five commands
and may write generated output during `plugin:build`.

Agent roles are generated too: edit `assets/agent-role-spec.json` for the fixed
capability pairs or `assets/agent-role-templates/` for duties, then run
`bun run agents:build`. The checked-in `assets/agents/` directory is derived
output, and `bun run agents:check` detects hand edits to that output.

Plugins and new tasks use cached, versioned content, so start a fresh task
after an update. For ownership, release rules, and safety details, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Intent, security, and review

Contributions made with or without AI tools are welcome and reviewed against
the same engineering evidence. Before changing an intentional boundary, read
the project’s [design intent](docs/design-intent.md) and
[security model](docs/security-model.md). Container Lab’s trusted-project and
temporary-storage decisions are documented in its [architecture](packages/skizzles-container-lab/docs/architecture.md).

> **Pre-release note:** the Git-based examples become runnable once the
repository and a versioned release are published. Stable marketplace
publication remains a separate release step; host wiring is optional
machine-local setup.
