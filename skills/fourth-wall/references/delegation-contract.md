# Delegation Contract

Use this contract for consequential delegated work. Keep it concrete enough that the recipient can act without reconstructing the parent's reasoning.

## Before Spawning

Define:

1. **Outcome:** the observable state this task must produce.
2. **Ownership:** files, modules, services, or product surface this task owns.
3. **Dependencies:** inputs that must already exist and downstream tasks waiting on this result.
4. **Constraints:** user decisions, architecture boundaries, relevant skills, and forbidden scope changes.
5. **Evidence:** exact checks, artifacts, screenshots, or source inspection expected at completion.
6. **Return shape:** changed areas, validation performed, unresolved risks, and the next recommended action.

When Triage exists, also define its canonical task name, accepted report path, report revision, and the narrow conditions under which the recipient should reactivate it.

For consequential or multi-owner work, include a **peer map** with only relevant canonical task paths and ownership/contact conditions. Workers receive Triage and relevant neighboring Workers; Triage receives affected Workers; Review receives Triage and reviewed Workers; QA/Designer receive owners when clarification or rework may need them. When a peer owns a relevant resource, record its stable identifier and locator plus the exact owner task path—for example, a Container Lab identifier and state/workspace path, an owned worktree/branch, or a critical evidence artifact. Route evidence or runtime requests to the current resource owner; the request does not transfer custody or create shared control. Review may request one bounded existing artifact or missing observation from that owner, while root coordinates repair or ownership changes. Paths are callable peer identities, not ownership transfer, and child contact never authorizes spawning.

State assurance explicitly: a Worker completion claim is unverified; accepted Triage evidence is provisional causal authority after root checks plausibility/source support; an independent Reviewer verdict is the highest independent-assurance recommendation; a Reviewer that supplied midstream Triage adjudication must label later verdicts reduced-independence/advisory; root owns final acceptance and uses a fresh Reviewer when consequential independent acceptance is required. Do not infer assurance from role metadata or configured effort.

## Complete Slice Test

Prefer a handoff that gives one child the complete causal loop: inspect the owned surface, implement the change, run focused validation, correct in-scope failures, and collect relevant runtime proof. A code-only handoff is too narrow when it predictably leaves the root with the longer test, integration, or proof campaign.

Keep shared Git mutations and final acceptance at the root. When parallel edits prevent lock-heavy checks, defer those checks until the tree stabilizes, then dispatch one integration Worker, Review, or QA leaf with the complete serial command or piloting contract.

## Spawn Shape

Encode the role and objective in the task name; the generated role catalog carries model and reasoning-effort binding:

```json
{
  "task_name": "worker__backend_contract",
  "fork_turns": "1",
  "agent_type": "worker",
  "message": "Own the bounded backend contract through implementation, focused validation, in-scope fixes, and compact evidence. Triage owner: triage__map_backend. Accepted report: /tmp/skizzles-orchestration/.../report.md ..."
}
```

Select the fixed native `agent_type`, omit independent model and reasoning overrides, and repeat only assignment-specific constraints. The canonical `assets/agent-role-spec.json` and generated installed role catalog are the sole authority for those bindings. Every child is a leaf; further decomposition returns to the root.

Include directly relevant skill names and obligations in the message. Skills available to the parent are not a substitute for telling the recipient which domain contract governs its work.

## Fan-Out Test

Spawn tasks in parallel only when all are true:

- Each owns a coherent responsibility boundary.
- Their write sets are disjoint or explicitly sequenced.
- Each can make meaningful progress without waiting for another spawned task.
- The root can continue useful cross-slice decisions, integration inspection, or planning without duplicating delegated execution.
- The expected speed or quality gain exceeds coordination cost.

Prefer dependency order over maximum concurrency. Contracts, schemas, and shared interfaces usually stabilize before broad implementation fan-out.

For a large, well-planned implementation, prefer 2-6 parallel Workers with disjoint complete slices over one exhausted Worker or a review-role implementation substitute. The installed limit of 6 active children per root session is a ceiling, not a target or a global memory budget. Count active roots and projects before choosing fan-out, and use fewer slots when the host is already busy.

## Resource And Memory Contract

Keep CGC graph queries available for ordinary repository discovery. New CGC
indexing and persistent directory watching remain explicit-authority operations;
do not start or multiply them across Workers without authorization.

Repository-wide tests, typechecks, builds, recursive analysis, indexing, and
broad lint or LSP runs are heavyweight operations. The root schedules at most
one heavyweight operation per root campaign at a time. Other Workers wait or
run focused checks rather than duplicate broad validation. This is a dispatch
contract, not a global semaphore, so independent root sessions remain outside
Skizzles' custody.

When abnormal memory pressure is observed or suspected, stop launching new
work and capture bounded process and memory evidence for the owner. Never
arbitrarily terminate CGC, Redis, or unrelated processes.

## Blockers

A valid blocker identifies one of:

- An unavailable external dependency, service, or permission.
- Contradictory requirements or a product/architecture decision only the owner can make.
- A safety boundary that forbids further authorized progress.

Task size, difficult code, uncertainty, failing tests, or the need for more investigation are not blockers by themselves. In particular, a failed local build, test, Container Lab run, or QA proof must not by itself mark a substantial goal or campaign `blocked`.

## Proof Failure Routing

Preserve a bounded command result and artifact path, classify the likely cause, and keep the campaign active when branch or base code, an owned fixture/config/migration, or an in-scope runtime contract plausibly caused the failure. Route the evidence to the owning Worker or persistent Triage owner, repair in scope, and rerun fresh proof. Unknown cause remains a diagnosis task, not a terminal disposition. Use `blocked` only for the external, contradictory-owner-decision, or safety cases above; never infer an external blocker from a failed local proof alone.

## Completion Claim

Require the task to report:

- What changed and where.
- What behavior is now true.
- What validation ran and its result.
- What did not run and why.
- Remaining risks, decisions, or downstream work.

After aggregate validation and an explicit decision when possible, root records the campaign terminal disposition (`accepted`, `rejected`, `blocked`, or `abandoned`) and finalizes a bounded latest snapshot at `/tmp/skizzles-orchestration/<campaign-id>/learning/campaign-close.md` on every terminal path, with the KPI schema and denominators in [learning-loop.md](learning-loop.md), even when values are zero or not observed. Forward only immutable revisioned artifacts with campaign/revision metadata, `supersedes` and correction details when applicable, and a verifiable integrity identity; an explicitly reopened campaign never overwrites an earlier forwarded revision. Separate repository friction from harness candidates. Forwarding is optional and explicit; observations never auto-mutate harness policy, roles, routing, hooks, tasks, configuration, or installs.

The root verifies this claim before integration or completion.

Completion releases active ownership but does not destroy the child. Use `followup_task` for reviewer-directed corrections or coherent next work by the same owner. Classify review findings: an explicit-contract miss is attributable rework, an adjacent existing defect is healing rather than failure, and a newly discovered invariant returns to Triage for clarification. Use a fresh task only for changed ownership, poisoned context, a genuinely independent second opinion, or a materially new slice.

When a durable `/tmp` report exists, pass its path rather than repeating stable cross-task context. The spawn message must still contain the role, concrete objective, ownership, constraints, Triage owner, report revision, and expected proof so the artifact supplements rather than hides the assignment. Do not put secrets, raw transcripts, or unbounded build logs in the packet.
