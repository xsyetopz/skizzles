# Install Skizzles

Keep installation deliberate and reversible. Never mutate a live Codex home, plugin marketplace, `PATH`, Docker, or launchd without the user's explicit approval.

## Choose the installation

- Use plain-skill mode when the user only wants skills. It manages selected directories below an explicit `CODEX_HOME/skills` and never activates hooks or runtime helpers.
- Use the official plugin flow when the user wants the complete Skizzles surface and accepts that its hooks may become available through the target marketplace.
- After the complete plugin surface is installed, choose `passive` orchestration to enable hooks without overriding Codex's native MultiAgentV2 defaults, or `aggressive` orchestration to activate proactive Fourth Wall routing.
- Use `link` for a trusted local checkout that should hot-reload source updates. Use `copy` for an isolated snapshot.
- Prefer a versioned release checkout for stable use. Treat `plugins/skizzles` as generated output and build it before a full-harness install.

Confirm the source checkout, absolute target `HOME`, absolute target `CODEX_HOME`, surface, and transfer method before running a non-dry-run command. Use temporary targets for demonstrations and validation. The current skills surface installs every public skill as one owned set.

The complete plugin bundles the installer at `packages/skizzles-installer/`; run the commands below from the plugin root or a selected source checkout. If this skill was installed by itself with the Skills CLI, do not assume that package exists beside it. Ask the user to select a Skizzles release or commit, obtain and verify that versioned checkout, then run the installer from its root.

## Install the plugin

Plugin and direct-skill copies are alternatives for the same skill. Before installing or enabling the plugin, inspect the active skill inventory and remove any direct Skizzles copy through the tool that installed it. Conversely, do not directly install a skill already supplied by the enabled plugin.

Use the official Codex plugin lifecycle for normal installation:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/robertmsale/skizzles
codex plugin add skizzles@skizzles
codex plugin list
```

Plugin skills are namespaced, such as `$skizzles:fourth-wall`; direct skills use plain identifiers, such as `$fourth-wall`. Codex installs a cached snapshot, so start a new task after installation or update. Use the official plugin and marketplace removal commands for normal installed plugins.

## Run the source-development lifecycle

From the selected Skizzles checkout, preview first:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts install \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --surface skills --transfer link --dry-run
```

For an isolated source-linked development harness, build and check `plugins/skizzles` first, then preview the custom harness surface against an explicit disposable home:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts install \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --home /absolute/target/home \
  --surface harness --transfer link --dry-run
```

Run the preview again without `--dry-run` only after reviewing its exact targets. Diagnose or remove the receipt-owned install with the same explicit roots:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts doctor --home /absolute/target/home --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts uninstall --surface skills --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home --dry-run
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts uninstall --surface harness --home /absolute/target/home --dry-run
```

The custom harness surface is for isolated development and test fixtures, not a second stable plugin installer. Install, update, or uninstall a stable versioned plugin through the official Codex plugin/marketplace flow instead. The installer fails closed on foreign targets. Skills receipts live below `CODEX_HOME/.skizzles/`; harness receipts live below `HOME/.skizzles/`. Uninstall verifies receipt-listed links or copied content and restores the exact marketplace state it owned. Do not bypass conflicts by deleting or overwriting paths for the user.

For a convenient complete checkout-local setup, use the installer’s composed
`local-suite` command. It is still a development harness, not a replacement
for the official marketplace flow, and it requires explicit roots, binary,
transfer mode, and policy choices:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts local-suite \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --home /absolute/target/home \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --codex-binary /absolute/path/to/codex \
  --transfer link --orchestration aggressive --instructions skizzles --dry-run
```

The command inspects both receipts before writing. A healthy receipt-owned
harness is a noop; absent targets are installed. Receipt-owned configuration
values that differ from the selected profile are replaced, while their
original `before` values remain the restoration baseline. Changing profiles
restores keys no longer selected. Foreign or unreceipted plugin/marketplace
targets and receipt-managed plugin drift are hard conflicts. If configuration
commits but the harness transfer fails, keep the receipt and use the reported
`unconfigure` recovery path; never delete receipts or overwrite foreign paths.

## Complete the Codex configuration

Only run this lifecycle after the complete plugin surface—and therefore its packaged hook—has been installed. It is independent from skill/plugin file transfer so a user can change machine policy without reinstalling content.

Ask the user to choose an orchestration mode:

- `passive` writes only `features.hooks = true`. It does not write any MultiAgentV2 setting or hint, so Codex retains its model-specific native defaults.
- `aggressive` also enables MultiAgentV2, sets `max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 6`, and adds concise pointers to the Fourth Wall skill advertised in the active inventory. Six is a per-root-session ceiling for bounded parallel ownership, not a target or a global memory budget. Schedule at most one heavyweight operation per root campaign; keep CGC graph queries available, while new indexing and persistent watchers still require explicit authorization. If abnormal memory pressure appears, stop launching new work and capture bounded evidence; do not arbitrarily terminate CGC or Redis. Use this only when the user wants autonomous quality-and-speed delegation.

Also ask whether Codex should keep its native model instructions or use the Skizzles split:

- `native` is the default and does not write instruction or agent-role config.
- `skizzles` writes the canonical root prompt to `model_instructions_file` and configures the seven fixed native roles advertised by `assets/agents/manifest.json`. Generated role files combine one behavioral duty with one selected model/reasoning pair, share `skizzles_subagent_instructions.md`, and add duty-specific `developer_instructions`. This mode requires an absolute `--source-root` whose assets remain available after installation; plugin presence alone does not configure the roles.

With the Skizzles split, select the generated `agent_type`, omit independent model/reasoning overrides, and use the smallest useful positive integer for `fork_turns`. A positive integer larger than the available history retains all available turns without becoming full-history mode. Do not use `fork_turns="none"` or `fork_turns="all"`: context-free and full-history spawning discard the bounded role handoff or inherit the parent role, respectively, bypassing selected-role application.

Role/model/reasoning continuity is guaranteed only while the selected child remains resident. Eviction or reload ends that guarantee, and reactivation alone does not prove the prior settings survived. When continuity matters, create a fresh sibling with explicit role selection and a compact handoff.

Compatibility is checked at configuration time against the selected
`--codex-binary`. Before any app-server RPC, receipt, or config write,
`configure` runs a bounded `--version` probe and rejects malformed, failed,
timed-out, or below-floor results. **Do not use Codex CLI `0.145.0` for
Skizzles orchestration.** It is a known broken, token-wasting host; upgrade to
Codex CLI `0.146.0-alpha.3` or newer before running `configure`. The inclusive
minimum is `0.146.0-alpha.3` (later prereleases, final `0.146.0`, and newer
versions pass). Content transfer remains separate and can copy the plugin or
skills without activating host configuration. `configure` also requires a
POSIX host with owned process-group support; unsupported hosts refuse
configuration while transfer-only installation remains available. The
configured-role same-root core also requires `--instructions skizzles` (or
equivalent generated roles), and Desktop extras remain inventory-scoped:
cross-root operations are available only when advertised.

Preview against an explicit `CODEX_HOME` and absolute Codex binary:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts configure \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --codex-binary /absolute/path/to/codex \
  --orchestration aggressive \
  --instructions skizzles \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --dry-run
```

Review the reported key list, then repeat without `--dry-run`. Restore the exact prior values with:

```sh
bun run packages/skizzles-installer/src/cli.ts unconfigure \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --codex-binary /absolute/path/to/codex --dry-run
```

Repeat restoration without `--dry-run` only after previewing it. The lifecycle launches that Codex binary's app-server against the selected home and uses native `config/read` plus atomic `config/batchWrite` with version-conflict detection. Its receipt lives at `CODEX_HOME/.skizzles/config-receipt.json`; restoration fails closed if an owned value drifted. It never edits `AGENTS.md`, `developer_instructions`, approvals, permissions, goals, model defaults, MCP registrations, or unrelated feature flags. With `--instructions skizzles`, it additionally owns `model_instructions_file` and the generated Skizzles role `description` and `config_file` leaves listed by the manifest. When the `agents` table or role was initially absent, empty receipt-owned parents are cleaned up on restoration, while later user-created roles and nickname fields remain untouched. Do not manually delete the receipt to bypass a conflict.

Configuration upgrades are an explicit restore-and-reapply lifecycle because `configure` refuses to overwrite an active receipt. Preview `unconfigure` with the absolute Codex binary recorded in the receipt, run it only when the owned values are drift-free, preview the new `configure`, then apply it. Do not delete or rewrite the receipt by hand; that discards the exact restoration boundary Skizzles uses to preserve unrelated config.

Maintainers edit `assets/agent-role-spec.json` for model/reasoning pairs and `assets/agent-role-templates/*.toml` for behavioral duties. Run `bun run agents:build` to regenerate `assets/agents/`, and `bun run agents:check` to detect drift. Never hand-edit generated role TOML or its manifest.

## Optionally configure a learning consumer

Fourth Wall maintains a bounded latest campaign-close snapshot under `/tmp/skizzles-orchestration/<campaign-id>/learning/campaign-close.md` and emits immutable revisioned forwarding artifacts under that campaign's `learning/forwarded/` directory. This is evidence, not an automatic harness change. If the user explicitly wants harness learning forwarded, guide them to:

1. Choose an existing local project whose owner can evaluate orchestration behavior. A versioned checkout of the official OpenAI Codex repository is a useful recommendation when the consumer must inspect harness implementation, but it is never a prerequisite.
2. Choose a stable consumer naming or epoch convention and record the routing in machine-local instructions (for example, `AGENTS.md`) by an explicit user action.
3. Forward only the new immutable revisioned artifact or its path after the user confirms the unique consumer and destination. Never forward the mutable latest snapshot. If later evidence reopens the campaign, preserve the prior artifact and forward a new revision that identifies what it supersedes and summarizes the correction.

Private campaign observations never belong in the source checkout or generated plugin. If an owner explicitly wants durable local curation, they may manually create `CODEX_HOME/.skizzles/learning/` with mode `0700` and `learning-log.md` with mode `0600`. That user-owned record is outside installation receipts and transfer targets; do not create, copy, package, or add it to Git on the user's behalf.

The installer must not clone or modify a repository, edit `AGENTS.md`, create or message tasks, or guess when a consumer is absent or ambiguous. Report the packet to the human owner instead. Consumer review may propose changes, but promotion into Skizzles skills, roles, routing, hooks, configuration, or installs always requires separate owner deliberation.

## Use Container Lab deliberately

A skill-only installation contains Container Lab guidance and its launcher, not the runnable CLI. Its launcher uses a distinct installed `codex-container-lab` PATH binary when one exists; otherwise it exits with a compact instruction to obtain the full Skizzles plugin or source checkout. The stable Skizzles plugin includes the dependency-self-contained operational and reaper bundles; a selected source checkout includes the canonical workspace package.

Use the `scripts/codex-container-lab` launcher beside the public `codex-container-lab` skill before relying on any `PATH` command. `doctorContainerLab` reports only the optional PATH convenience; bundled ownership paths and source provenance come from `integrations/container-lab.json`. Host PATH and LaunchAgent activation remain explicit, reversible wiring, not part of a skill-only or plugin install.

Read the canonical [Container Lab installation and optional host-wiring guide](../../packages/skizzles-container-lab/docs/installation.md) from the selected checkout or plugin snapshot. Keep doctor health probes on disposable owner/state/runtime roots. Never wrap an attached `run`, invoke live reaping, edit `PATH`, or load launchd as part of a skill/plugin install; host wiring is separate, explicit, reversible, and machine-local.

An installed bundle with an unavailable Docker daemon is `installed-not-ready`, not proof that Container Lab is broken. The configured `0.1.0` compatibility is unverified until a release fingerprint is supplied.

## Enable the optional Luna V2 catalog

Skizzles includes `runtime/model-catalog.ts` and `assets/com.openai.skizzles-model-catalog.plist` for owners who have independently verified Luna with MultiAgentV2. This is explicit host wiring, not part of ordinary skill/plugin installation.

Read `assets/model-catalog-installation.md` from the selected source checkout or plugin snapshot. The generator preserves the full upstream model catalog and changes only `gpt-5.6-luna.multi_agent_version` from `v1` to `v2`. It never reads or copies credentials. It accepts only a fresh, version-matched, complete `CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json`, otherwise uses the selected Codex binary's bundled catalog, and preflights the result through that binary before promotion.

Render and validate the LaunchAgent before loading it, then set the global `model_catalog_json` to the generated absolute path. A generated catalog is applied only at app-server startup; restart app-server after a refresh reports `catalogChanged: true`. The status `generation` is the stable catalog identity, while `catalogChanged` describes only its most recent refresh. Do not restart Desktop or app-server automatically while tasks are active. If upstream already marks Luna V2, the overlay reports `upstream-v2` and leaves that field unchanged.

## Finish on a new task

Tell the user what was installed, whether it was linked or copied, which instruction mode was selected, and where the receipt lives. Restart app-server after changing model instructions, then start a new Codex task so the selected config, skills, hooks, and role prompt are discovered cleanly; never claim the current task hot-reloaded them.
