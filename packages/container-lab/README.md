# Codex Container Lab

Codex Container Lab is Skizzles' canonical Bun/TypeScript package for disposable Docker Compose development environments. Each Codex thread owns isolated Git workspace clones, guarded synchronization, and exact-label cleanup. There is no MCP execution server or secondary command scheduler.

This directory is the private `@skizzles/container-lab` workspace package. Production code lives in `src/`, tests live in `test/`, install material lives in `install/`, and the package-owned integration descriptor lives in `assets/integrations/container-lab.json`. The repository root `bun.lock` is the only lockfile. The supported package facade is `src/service.ts`; the two public binaries are declared explicitly in `package.json`. Stable Skizzles plugins carry dependency-self-contained CLI and reaper bundles, and the public skill launcher works before PATH wiring exists.

Project topology belongs to the consuming repository. A committed `.codex-container-lab.yaml` selects existing Compose files and a command service, or uses Dockerfile/image shorthand normalized into the same one-service Compose lifecycle. The engine adds only the isolated workspace mount, exact ownership labels, init behavior, and declared random loopback ports.

Manifests keep `environment` (explicit command-service list-form forwarding) separate from optional `secret_environment` (Compose top-level sources backed by the invoking CLI environment). Secret names are retained for lifecycle bookkeeping; secret values are ephemeral and redacted from generated configuration diagnostics and every public or durable boundary. See the [manifest contract](docs/manifest.md) for the exact rules; the bundled examples leave `secret_environment` empty so they run without credentials.

## Quick start

1. From the Skizzles root, run `bun skills/codex-container-lab/scripts/codex-container-lab --help` to use the bundled launcher without PATH wiring. Read [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) before optional host wiring.
2. Copy the closest manifest from `examples/compose`, `examples/dockerfile`, or `examples/image` into a consuming Git repository.
3. From a Codex unified shell, run the skill launcher with `health`, then `lab create --name experiment`. `CODEX_THREAD_ID` supplies the exact owner automatically.
4. Run work with the launcher and `run --lab LAB_ID -- COMMAND...`, synchronize through `sync preview`/`sync apply`, then explicitly destroy labs. The command stays attached to Codex's unified shell, which owns backgrounding, polling, stdin, signals, and final status. The periodic archive reaper is a crash/abandonment backstop, not the normal lifecycle.

For manual use outside Codex, every operation requires an explicit owner override; the CLI never invents ownership. See the [CLI architecture](docs/architecture.md), [manifest contract](docs/manifest.md), [safety model](docs/safety.md), and binding [completion contract](docs/completion-contract.md). The former standalone checkout is rollback history only and is no longer live authority.
