# Architecture

Container Lab is canonical Skizzles source at `packages/skizzles-container-lab`. The root Skizzles workspace and `bun.lock` own its dependency graph. Stable plugins stage dependency-self-contained Bun bundles at `packages/skizzles-container-lab/src/{cli,reaper-cli}.ts`; the public skill launcher resolves those same relative paths before any PATH activation.

Codex Container Lab consists of two Skizzles-bundled Bun entrypoints and no MCP server. The PATH binaries are optional explicit host conveniences:

- `codex-container-lab` performs lab, attached command, log, synchronization, and explicit cleanup operations.
- `codex-container-lab-reaper` is a short-lived, one-shot scanner suitable for a per-user macOS LaunchAgent interval.

The ownership unit is the exact current Codex thread id. Unified shell commands receive it as `CODEX_THREAD_ID`; manual callers must pass an explicit owner override. Filesystem directories use a collision-resistant owner hash, while authoritative manifests and every managed Docker/Compose resource retain the exact owner value. An owner may create multiple labs across CLI invocations.

Small owner and lab manifests live in a durable per-user state directory. They record ownership, source checkout, runtime location, Compose identity, lifecycle state, endpoints, safety findings, managed image identity, and (for new manifests) the last successful authenticated lab activity. Disposable clones, generated Compose files, sync baselines/tokens/journals, and backups live under an injectable temporary runtime root. Tests inject both roots.

## Parallel workflow and storage

Container Lab is primarily a parallelization and reproducible-experiment primitive. Multiple tasks or counterfactual hypotheses can start from the same reviewed checkpoint, receive independent Git workspaces and Compose identities, complete their own inspect-edit-build-test-fix loops, and return selected changes through guarded synchronization or ordinary Git patches. The root task owns final integration into the host checkout.

Independent labs intentionally duplicate their clones and any build output written below `/workspace`, including `target/`, `node_modules`, generated files, test databases, or platform build directories. Container images, BuildKit caches, and project-declared external bind mounts remain separate Docker or project concerns and are not broadly pruned by Container Lab.

The system temporary runtime root is intentional:

- it avoids imposing a persistent `.tmp` convention or ignore policy on every consuming repository;
- it keeps runtime ownership independent of repository layout;
- exact `lab destroy` can remove positively owned workspaces;
- the archive reaper can recover exact-owned resources abandoned by archived threads;
- operating-system temporary-storage cleanup and reboot recovery remain available after severe disk or swap pressure.

Moving the same artifacts into a worktree-local `.tmp` directory would not reduce their size. Explicit destruction remains the normal lifecycle. The reaper is an archive backstop and, for active owners, a conservative seven-day per-lab inactivity retention limit based only on the last successful authenticated Container Lab operation. Missing, malformed, or future lease timestamps are retained. This is not proof that a thread is inactive. Cleanup takes the owner and lab activity locks, rechecks state and freshness, and reaps only exact-owned paths. It never broadly prunes Docker or deletes unidentified temporary content.

Archive cleanup writes a small exact-owner reaped tombstone outside the removable owner directory while holding the shared owner lock. A create queued behind cleanup therefore cannot recreate resources for an already reaped archived identity; manual work must use a new owner identity.

Creation is synchronous: the CLI persists `provisioning`, provisions in the attached process, and records `ready` or a compact `failed` state before returning. Catchable interruption records `failed` after exact cleanup. An uncatchable host termination can leave the durable state at `provisioning`; that manifest and its exact ownership labels remain intentionally destroyable by `lab destroy` and eligible for exact archive cleanup.

Arbitrary commands have exactly one lifecycle. `codex-container-lab run` starts an in-container process group and remains attached while stdout and stderr stream through the normal terminal. Codex unified execution owns background sessions, polling, waiting, stdin, signals, and final exit status. Timeout or host signals trigger bounded in-container process-group termination so an exec cannot be orphaned. The ephemeral run identity is never persisted, and there is no second scheduler. Long-lived application services belong in Compose.

The lifecycle retains one Compose path. Project Compose files remain in the consuming checkout and are passed to Docker in manifest order. Image and Dockerfile modes generate an internal base Compose file. Every mode receives a generated override containing exact labels, the isolated workspace bind, `init`, declared random loopback publications, and non-sensitive lab metadata. Dockerfile mode also applies the exact labels at build time; cleanup verifies them on the tagged image and removes only its validated immutable image id.

Manifest `environment` and `secret_environment` are separate allowlists. The former remains list-form forwarding for the command service. The latter authorizes project-owned top-level Compose secret sources shaped as `{ environment: VAR }`; every allowlisted name must be present in the invoking CLI environment, and every environment-backed source in the normalized model must be allowlisted. Only names are retained in normalized configuration and durable manifests. Secret values are supplied ephemerally to Compose config/up, never to generated YAML, argv, state, metadata, findings, errors, or public output. Names shared by the two fields are rejected. A no-interpolation normalized model is checked for declared source-name references in plaintext service environments without value comparison, and Compose diagnostics are replaced with fixed redacted errors.

Docker runs only on the host. Generated configuration never adds a Docker socket or ambient credentials implicitly; `secret_environment` is the explicit ephemeral path for declared Compose secret sources. The normalized Compose model is inspected for host binds, socket binds, privileged mode, host namespaces, devices, capabilities, secrets, configs, and non-loopback or fixed publications. Findings describe trusted-project configuration; they are not a hostile-project sandbox policy.

Synchronization includes Git-tracked and non-ignored untracked files. It uses a three-way baseline, five-minute single-use preview tokens, digest-based stale checks, transactional backups, recovery journals, and a crash-recoverable per-lab activity lock that excludes attached execution while preview/apply runs. Attached commands use argv after `--`; the configured shell is used only as the container-side launcher needed to establish and clean up the process group.

The public JSON boundary uses compact purpose-built response objects. It never serializes durable lab manifests or runtime configuration. Compose status is reduced to service name/state/health summaries, service log tails have line and byte caps, and internal owner hashes, generated paths, Compose arguments, image bookkeeping, and process identities remain private. A failed Compose-up captures one bounded, redacted per-lab artifact before exact Docker cleanup; it may combine lifecycle output with logs only for manifest-backed failed command or declared-port services whose terminal status has a non-zero exited code or unhealthy health. Healthy services, exit-zero services unless unhealthy, and unexposed service logs are excluded. Its optional `evidence` descriptor is an opaque availability record, never a host path. The owner may retrieve the bounded redacted transcript with `lab diagnostic --lab ID` while the lab remains failed. Diagnostic capture is best effort and cannot replace the original provisioning error or block cleanup.

The stable administrative response shapes are:

- `health`: `{ok,dockerAvailable,labs}`
- `lab create`: `{labId,state}`
- `lab list`: `{labs:[{labId,name,state,updatedAt}]}`
- `lab status`: `{labId,name,state,updatedAt,endpoints?,endpointCount?,findings?,findingCount?,error?,provisioningFailure?,stack?}`; failed Compose-up records contain only `{phase,capturedAt,services,serviceCount,evidence?}`, where `evidence` is `{kind,available,bytes,lines,truncated}` and never a filesystem path. Bounded arrays expose actionable entries while counts disclose omitted entries, and `stack.services` contains only `{service,state,health?,exitCode?}` summaries
- `lab diagnostic --lab ID`: `{labId,diagnostic:{phase,capturedAt,services,serviceCount,evidence,transcript:{text,truncated,bytes,lines}}}` for an owner-scoped failed lab; it rejects ready labs and never exposes the backing runtime path
- `lab destroy`: `{labId,destroyed}`; `lab destroy-all`: `{destroyed}`
- `logs`: `{labId,service,transcript:{text,truncated,bytes,lines}}`
- `sync preview`: `{labId,direction,token,expiresAt,changes,conflicts,changeCount,conflictCount,truncated}`; `sync apply`: `{labId,direction,applied}`

Administrative JSON is capped at 16 KiB. Service transcript text is capped at 8 KiB and 500 requested lines. If unusual JSON escaping would exceed the public ceiling, the command fails closed instead of emitting an oversized record. `run` has no JSON footer: its complete output is the attached terminal stream, and Codex's command-output supervisor provides the durable inspection artifact when it compacts a long command.

The reaper writes nothing for a clean scan. A cleanup or exceptional scan emits only `{ok,cleaned,retained,issues?}` with counts, at most six bounded redacted details, and a 1,536-byte ceiling; active owner identities are never listed.

The reaper opens Codex's SQLite state database read-only in place so SQLite can read its WAL safely. It validates the required `threads` schema before considering cleanup. Archived owners retain their existing exact-row, final-recheck cleanup semantics. Consistent active owners are scanned for individually expired lab leases; the reaper refreshes no lease and treats missing, malformed, and future timestamps as retained. Active rows changing state, missing rows, inconsistent archive markers, schema mismatch, busy/unavailable/corrupt databases, invalid manifests, and any other uncertainty retain the stack. Cleanup uses exact managed/owner labels and never infers that stopping a process or archiving a different thread ended ownership.
