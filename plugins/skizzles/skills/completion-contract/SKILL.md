# Completion Contract

Use this skill to turn a task into a concrete completion contract. A completion contract is not a plan, estimate, suggestion list, or escape hatch. It states the smallest final condition that must be true before the work can be called done. Keep a routine local change to its outcome, applicable constraints, and focused proof; use the fuller planning and coordination guidance when work is substantial, consequential, delegated, or materially ambiguous. The contract fixes the required result, not a rigid implementation method.

## Authority Order

Preserve this order:

1. Permanent user or repo instructions.
2. Explicit user non-negotiables.
3. User-approved plan.
4. Task-specific outcome.
5. Agent implementation preference.

Do not let a worker plan, convenience path, or smaller first slice weaken a higher-authority item.

## Contract Draft

Write the smallest contract that makes the requested final state and its proof observable. Routine local changes need only the outcome, applicable constraints, and focused evidence. Use the fuller schema for substantial or consequential work, or before a handoff or delegation where scope could drift:

```text
Outcome:
Approved implementation path:
Non-negotiable constraints:
Disallowed alternatives:
Legacy/removal expectations:
Regression expectations:
Evidence expected:
Validation baseline:
Repository-red handling:
Known valid blockers:
Unknowns requiring clarification:
```

An approved plan is useful input, not a prerequisite. If there is no prewritten plan, make a proportionate plan or ask only about a missing decision that would materially change the final state, scope, authority, or risk. Do not silently narrow scope to avoid that question. Fill each applicable field; omitting an explicit constraint does not weaken it.

## Validation Integrity And Repository-Red Baselines

A passing command is evidence only when the accepted validation contract remains at least as strong as its baseline. Do not manufacture a passing result by disabling checks or formatters, downgrading severity, broadening ignores, adding suppression directives, changing exit behavior, or replacing a canonical command with a weaker one. Treat those as validation-policy changes that require explicit owner approval, not implementation repairs.

When practical, establish the relevant validation baseline before editing. If a gate fails after editing, classify it instead of assuming that every diagnostic belongs to the task:

| Classification | Required response |
|---|---|
| **Task-attributable failure** | Repair it within the owned task, then rerun the affected proof. |
| **Pre-existing bounded failure** | Preserve policy, run the narrowest supported proof for the changed surface, and report the remaining baseline failure without claiming the canonical gate passed. |
| **Large or systemic repository-red failure** | Preserve policy, retain bounded evidence, measure and summarize the repository-health condition, finish only what can be truthfully proved, and recommend a separate cleanup campaign. |

If no pre-edit baseline exists, use touched paths, changed behavior, diagnostic provenance, and repository history to distinguish attribution. Do not silently absorb broad pre-existing cleanup into a small task, and do not reinterpret recently created, modified, or untracked validation configuration as disposable scaffolding. Existing user and collaborator changes retain their ownership regardless of Git tracking state.

Treat the baseline as systemically red when its breadth makes task attribution or useful inline inspection unreliable—for example, diagnostics span many unrelated files or rules, output is truncated or redirected to a managed artifact, or correction would materially exceed the requested ownership boundary. Numeric thresholds are signals rather than policy; a hundred repetitive findings in one generated file may be more bounded than twenty unrelated architectural failures.

For a repository-red handoff, report a compact measurement rather than dumping the transcript:

- Exact command, working directory, tool version when relevant, and exit status.
- Error and warning counts, affected-file count, and touched-surface versus unrelated counts when available.
- A few dominant rule or failure categories without unbounded examples.
- Whether output was truncated and the bounded artifact path, with secrets and private data excluded.
- Which narrower checks passed, which canonical gate remains red, and what therefore remains unverified.
- The expected cost benefit of a dedicated cleanup: faster validation, smaller outputs, clearer attribution, fewer agent turns and retries, and lower risk of accidental suppression.

Repository-red is a health finding, not permission to broaden the current task, automatically create another task, or weaken policy. Recommend cleanup for the owner to deliberate separately.

## Fan-Out

When work is substantial or consequential and has independent, coherent boundaries, split it before execution rather than letting a worker shrink scope during execution. For a routine localized task, keep one owner; delegation is not a target.

Good boundaries:

- API/contracts
- storage or persistence
- backend implementation
- frontend integration
- design polish
- QA validation
- deployment/infrastructure

Bad boundaries when they merely defer or shrink the requested outcome:

- first slice
- make a start
- easiest part
- best effort
- docs-only substitute

Each delegated package must cover the full responsibility for its boundary and map back to the top-level outcome. Do not create a partial package merely because it is easy to dispatch.

## Requirements

For substantial or consequential work, write one main obligation per material requirement. For routine work, include only the obligations that apply and prove the changed boundary. Prefer obligations that are observable and hard to fake:

- implement
- remove
- replace
- wire
- preserve
- prove
- validate
- update
- delete
- migrate
- enforce
- route
- render
- persist
- reject
- fail

Treat these formulations as scope-shrink risks when they hide an incomplete required outcome:

```text
if possible
where possible
try to
attempt to
best effort
if too large
if time allows
fallback
temporary
for now
MVP
first slice
partial
stub
mock
document a workaround
leave the old path
keep both paths
manual step
remove or hard-disable
compatibility entrypoint
tombstone
legacy wrapper
```

An MVP, prototype, or milestone is valid when the user explicitly approves it as the intended scope. It must not silently replace the requested correct final outcome. State the final-state obligation directly, but leave the implementation sequence, tool choice, and decomposition open unless a higher-authority instruction fixes them. Do not add proof for unrelated systems or chase exhaustive theoretical coverage beyond the changed boundary; expand checks when risk, a public contract, or an integration boundary warrants it.

## Valid Blockers

Accept blockers only when they are concrete and outside the current authority, or when an explicit missing user decision blocks a material action:

- missing permissions
- unavailable external services
- missing required secrets
- inaccessible required files
- contradictory instructions
- unsafe work
- explicit missing user decision

Do not accept task size, difficulty, uncertainty, refactor effort, stale failing tests, or lack of a convenient path as blockers.

## Clobber Audit

Before execution or final acceptance, audit the contract against the assigned boundary. For routine work, answer the questions that apply to the changed surface; substantial or consequential work should cover the full audit:

- Did the contract preserve the user-approved outcome?
- Did it shrink scope into a partial job?
- Did it add fallback or compatibility paths the user did not ask for?
- Did it preserve legacy names, wrappers, disabled entrypoints, or tombstones?
- Did it require evidence that can actually be inspected?
- Did it allow fake UI, fake data, disabled checks, skipped tests, or manual workarounds?
- Did it ignore relevant skills, repo instructions, or role constraints?

Final responses should include the concrete evidence used: changed files, tests or commands, screenshots, source inspection, artifacts, or exact blockers. Report focused evidence for the claimed boundary rather than implying exhaustive validation.

## Forward-Progress Checkpoints

For substantial or consequential work, treat commits as validated repository checkpoints, independent of `/goal` lifecycle. A goal tracks the overall outcome; a commit records one coherent causal state. A routine local change need not create a dedicated checkpoint merely because this skill was used. Do not require or create a goal merely to obtain commit boundaries.

When a checkpoint is appropriate, commit after a coherent ownership slice is integrated, its focused proof passes, and no known breakage remains in that slice. Prefer a checkpoint before switching causal surfaces, beginning a risky refactor, transferring substantial ownership, or starting independent QA or Review. Keep unrelated slices separate and write commit messages in terms of the behavioral outcome.

In a coordinated substantial task, do not commit every child completion automatically. The root first inspects shared-worktree ownership, integrates the slice, excludes unrelated user or agent changes, and verifies the evidence. Do not checkpoint a known-broken intermediate state merely to reduce diff size. Preserve reviewer corrections as later commits when practical so accepted history remains inspectable. Before final acceptance of such work, validate the aggregate commit series and working tree, not only the newest checkpoint.
