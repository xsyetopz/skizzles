# Install Skizzles

Keep installation deliberate and reversible. Never mutate a live Codex home, plugin marketplace, `PATH`, Docker, or launchd without the user's explicit approval.

## Choose the installation

- Use plain-skill mode when the user only wants skills. It manages selected directories below an explicit `CODEX_HOME/skills` and never activates hooks or runtime helpers.
- Use full-harness mode only when the user wants the generated Skizzles plugin and accepts that its hooks may become available through the target marketplace.
- After the complete plugin surface is installed, choose `passive` orchestration to enable hooks without overriding Codex's native MultiAgentV2 defaults, or `aggressive` orchestration to activate proactive Fourth Wall routing.
- Use `link` for a trusted local checkout that should hot-reload source updates. Use `copy` for an isolated snapshot.
- Prefer a versioned release checkout for stable use. Treat `plugins/skizzles` as generated output and build it before a full-harness install.

Confirm the source checkout, absolute target `HOME`, absolute target `CODEX_HOME`, surface, and transfer method before running a non-dry-run command. Use temporary targets for demonstrations and validation. The current skills surface installs every public skill as one owned set.

The complete plugin bundles the installer at `packages/installer/`; run the commands below from the plugin root or a selected source checkout. If this skill was installed by itself with the Skills CLI, do not assume that package exists beside it. Ask the user to select a Skizzles release or commit, obtain and verify that versioned checkout, then run the installer from its root.

## Run the lifecycle

From the selected Skizzles checkout, preview first:

```sh
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts install \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --surface skills --transfer link --dry-run
```

For an isolated source-linked development harness, build and check `plugins/skizzles` first, then preview the custom harness surface against an explicit disposable home:

```sh
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts install \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --home /absolute/target/home \
  --surface harness --transfer link --dry-run
```

Run the preview again without `--dry-run` only after reviewing its exact targets. Diagnose or remove the receipt-owned install with the same explicit roots:

```sh
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts doctor --home /absolute/target/home --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts uninstall --surface skills --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home --dry-run
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts uninstall --surface harness --home /absolute/target/home --dry-run
```

The custom harness surface is for isolated development and test fixtures. Install, update, or uninstall a stable versioned plugin through the official Codex plugin/marketplace flow instead; plugin installs are cached snapshots and a new task may be required. The installer fails closed on foreign targets. Skills receipts live below `CODEX_HOME/.skizzles/`; harness receipts live below `HOME/.skizzles/`. Uninstall verifies receipt-listed links or copied content and restores the exact marketplace state it owned. Do not bypass conflicts by deleting or overwriting paths for the user.

## Complete the Codex configuration

Only run this lifecycle after the complete plugin surface—and therefore its packaged hook—has been installed. It is independent from skill/plugin file transfer so a user can change machine policy without reinstalling content.

Ask the user to choose an orchestration mode:

- `passive` writes only `features.hooks = true`. It does not write any MultiAgentV2 setting or hint, so Codex retains its model-specific native defaults.
- `aggressive` also enables MultiAgentV2, sets `max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 7`, adds one concise proactive mode hint, and gives roots and subagents short pointers to `$fourth-wall`. Use this only when the user wants autonomous quality-and-speed delegation.

Also ask whether Codex should keep its native model instructions or use the Skizzles split:

- `native` is the default and does not write instruction or agent-role config.
- `skizzles` writes the canonical root prompt to `model_instructions_file` and configures native `default`, `triage`, `worker`, `designer`, `qa`, `review`, and `deployment` roles from `assets/agents/*.toml`. Every role shares `skizzles_subagent_instructions.md`; specialized roles add their duty through `developer_instructions`. This mode requires an absolute `--source-root` whose assets remain available after installation.

With the Skizzles split, pass the selected `agent_type` and use `fork_turns="none"` or a positive integer. A positive integer larger than the available history retains all available turns without becoming full-history mode. Do not use `fork_turns="all"`: full-history spawning inherits the parent role and deliberately bypasses selected-role application.

Preview against an explicit `CODEX_HOME` and absolute Codex binary:

```sh
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts configure \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --codex-binary /absolute/path/to/codex \
  --orchestration aggressive \
  --instructions skizzles \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/skizzles \
  --dry-run
```

Review the reported key list, then repeat without `--dry-run`. Restore the exact prior values with:

```sh
bun run packages/installer/src/cli.ts unconfigure \
  --codex-home /absolute/target/codex-home \
  --codex-binary /absolute/path/to/codex --dry-run
```

Repeat restoration without `--dry-run` only after previewing it. The lifecycle launches that Codex binary's app-server against the selected home and uses native `config/read` plus atomic `config/batchWrite` with version-conflict detection. Its receipt lives at `CODEX_HOME/.skizzles/config-receipt.json`; restoration fails closed if an owned value drifted. It never edits `AGENTS.md`, `developer_instructions`, approvals, permissions, goals, model defaults, MCP registrations, or unrelated feature flags. With `--instructions skizzles`, it additionally owns `model_instructions_file` and the seven Skizzles role definitions. To restore configuration shape cleanly, the receipt owns the entire `agents` table when it was initially absent, an entire named-role table when that role was initially absent, or only `description` and `config_file` leaves when preserving an existing customized role. Later edits inside a structurally owned table are treated as drift and block restoration. Do not manually delete the receipt to bypass a conflict.

## Use Container Lab deliberately

A skill-only installation contains Container Lab guidance and its launcher, not the runnable CLI. Its launcher uses a distinct installed `codex-container-lab` PATH binary when one exists; otherwise it exits with a compact instruction to obtain the full Skizzles plugin or source checkout. The stable Skizzles plugin includes the dependency-self-contained operational and reaper bundles; a selected source checkout includes the canonical workspace package.

Use the `scripts/codex-container-lab` launcher beside the public `codex-container-lab` skill before relying on any `PATH` command. `doctorContainerLab` reports only the optional PATH convenience; bundled ownership paths and source provenance come from `integrations/container-lab.json`. Host PATH and LaunchAgent activation remain explicit, reversible wiring, not part of a skill-only or plugin install.

Read the canonical [Container Lab installation and optional host-wiring guide](../../packages/codex-container-lab/docs/installation.md) from the selected checkout or plugin snapshot. Keep doctor health probes on disposable owner/state/runtime roots. Never wrap an attached `run`, invoke live reaping, edit `PATH`, or load launchd as part of a skill/plugin install; host wiring is separate, explicit, reversible, and machine-local.

An installed bundle with an unavailable Docker daemon is `installed-not-ready`, not proof that Container Lab is broken. The configured `0.1.0` compatibility is unverified until a release fingerprint is supplied.

## Enable the optional Luna V2 catalog

Skizzles includes `runtime/model-catalog.ts` and `assets/com.openai.skizzles-model-catalog.plist` for owners who have independently verified Luna with MultiAgentV2. This is explicit host wiring, not part of ordinary skill/plugin installation.

Read `assets/model-catalog-installation.md` from the selected source checkout or plugin snapshot. The generator preserves the full upstream model catalog and changes only `gpt-5.6-luna.multi_agent_version` from `v1` to `v2`. It never reads or copies credentials. It accepts only a fresh, version-matched, complete `CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json`, otherwise uses the selected Codex binary's bundled catalog, and preflights the result through that binary before promotion.

Render and validate the LaunchAgent before loading it, then set the global `model_catalog_json` to the generated absolute path. A generated catalog is applied only at app-server startup; restart app-server after a refresh reports `catalogChanged: true`. The status `generation` is the stable catalog identity, while `catalogChanged` describes only its most recent refresh. Do not restart Desktop or app-server automatically while tasks are active. If upstream already marks Luna V2, the overlay reports `upstream-v2` and leaves that field unchanged.

## Finish on a new task

Tell the user what was installed, whether it was linked or copied, which instruction mode was selected, and where the receipt lives. Restart app-server after changing model instructions, then start a new Codex task so the selected config, skills, hooks, and role prompt are discovered cleanly; never claim the current task hot-reloaded them.
